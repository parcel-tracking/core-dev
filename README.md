# Parcel Tracking - Core Development

We test and develop a domain area based on a clean architecture that searches for delivery information scraped from courier companies using invoice numbers. The developed content is distributed to the [`core`](https://github.com/parcel-tracking/core) repository and is not used for any other purpose.
